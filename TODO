Week 32 goal:
  * server: get the sync to work for oslo (data push)

* [] get proper data on server (city, provider). Note: model on appspot is invalid now that I removed externalId for old data. Maybe we can just flush it out (easier than upgrade the model)
* [VICTOR] automate Oslo sync. Find a way to make our script run on the server (cron + fetch url, ...)
* [VICTOR] implement get stationAndStatuses

Week 33 goal:
  * client: rewrite the android client against our new API
  * server: clean up model&code, support more cities, 

* test automation
* clean up / refactor
* [JEROME] update android client to match new API
* [VICTOR] implement Paris client
* implement Barcelona
* implement Washington

Week 34 goal: 
  * client: iphone support alpha
  * server support history, design


FUTURE
* do we need to keep track of timezone ? Maybe in city
* remove public app-engine-patch references (e.g. http://mycitybikes.appspot.com/)
